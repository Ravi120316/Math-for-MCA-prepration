# MATRIX MULTIPLICATION – Properties (Desi Style)

## 1. Associative Property
(A × B) × C = A × (B × C)
Example: A=[[1,0],[2,1]], B=[[0,1],[1,0]], C=[[2,1],[3,4]]

## 2. Distributive Property
A × (B + C) = A × B + A × C

## 3. Non-Commutative Property
A × B != B × A (generally)

## 4. Multiplication with Identity
A × I = I × A = A

## 5. Multiplication with Zero
A × 0 = 0 × A = 0
